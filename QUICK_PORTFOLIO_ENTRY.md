# ClearGuide - Quick Portfolio Entry

## One-Liner
AI-powered web application that solves the problem of public document confusion by using AI to summarize, extract key fields, and provide clear action items—reducing citizen confusion and call center load.

## Short Description (2-3 sentences)
ClearGuide addresses the critical problem that many people struggle to understand public/government documents, leading to confusion, mistakes, and increased call center load. The platform uses OpenAI GPT-4o to analyze Korean government documents (tax notices, fines, community announcements) by summarizing content, extracting key fields, and providing clear action items (what to do, where, by when). This reduces citizen confusion, prevents mistakes, and reduces civil complaints/call center load, with the social impact of bridging information gaps and improving accessibility.
